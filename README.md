This tool is based on [UWPSpy](https://github.com/m417z/UWPSpy) source code and is used by [Unigram](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram) to monitor layout reentrancy issues.
The tool tracks any change to the UI tree and subscribes to all FrameworkElements SizeChanged event.
Whenever the process crashes due to a LayoutCycleException, a file containing the last 200 SizeChanged events is written in the app data local folder.
